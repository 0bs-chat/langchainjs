```typescript
import { OpenAI } from "langchain/llms/openai";

// To make the caching really obvious, lets use a slower model.
const model = new OpenAI({
  modelName: "text-davinci-002",
  cache: true,
  n: 2,
  bestOf: 2
});
```

## In Memory Cache

The default cache is stored in-memory. This means that if you restart your application, the cache will be cleared.

```typescript
// The first time, it is not yet in cache, so it should take longer
const res = await model.predict("Tell me a joke");
console.log(res);
```

</CodeOutputBlock>


```typescript
// The second time it is, so it goes faster
const res2 = await model.predict("Tell me a joke");
console.log(res2);
